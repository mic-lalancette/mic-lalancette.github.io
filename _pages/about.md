Welcome to my homepage! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/">Department of Statistical Sciences</a>, University of Toronto since September 2017, where I am supervised by Prof. Stanislav Volgushev. Prior to joining Toronto, I completed a B.Sc. in Mathematics and a M.Sc. in Statistics in the <a href="https://dms.umontreal.ca/">Departement of Mathematics and Statistics</a>, Université de Montréal.

<h2>Research</h2>
My current research interests lie in the estimation theory of dependence structures, mostly in the context of multivariate and spatial extreme values. I am particularly interested in methodologies for detecting tail (or asymptotic) independence between two random phenomena and estimating the tail dependence structure at the same time.
