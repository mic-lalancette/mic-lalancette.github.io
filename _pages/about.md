Welcome to my homepage! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/">Department of Statistical Sciences</a>, University of Toronto since September 2017, where I am supervised by Prof. Stanislav Volgushev. Prior to joining Toronto, I completed a B.Sc. in Mathematics and an M.Sc. in Statistics in the <a href="https://dms.umontreal.ca/">Department of Mathematics and Statistics</a>, Université de Montréal.
<br><br>
Outside of school, I especially enjoy making/drinking espresso and running (see my <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/30196526">Strava page</a>, which is not very consistent nowadays but had some more glorious days). I am also a huge music fan and have Spotify on many hours everyday (whether I am working or not).

Welcome to my homepage! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Technical University of Munich, in the <a href="https://www.math.cit.tum.de/statistics/startseite/">Research group on Mathematical Statistics</a> led by Prof. Mathias Drton. I am supported by a Postodoctoral fellowship from NSERC of Canada. I previously completed a Ph.D. at the <a href="https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/">Department of Statistical Sciences</a>, University of Toronto in 2022 under the supervision of Prof. Stanislav Volgushev. Prior to joining Toronto, I completed a B.Sc. in Mathematics (2015) and an M.Sc. in Statistics (2017) at the <a href="https://dms.umontreal.ca/">Department of Mathematics and Statistics</a>, Université de Montréal.

Outside of school, I especially enjoy making/drinking espresso, listening to music and going to live concerts, and running (see my <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/30196526">Strava page</a>, which is not very consistent nowadays but had some more glorious days).

<h2>Research</h2>
My current research interests lie in the estimation theory of dependence structures and copulas, mostly in the context of multivariate and spatial extreme values. I am particularly interested in methodologies for detecting tail (or asymptotic) independence between two random phenomena. I am also working on the estimation of graphical models for asymptotically dependent extremes, with a focus on high-dimensional data.
