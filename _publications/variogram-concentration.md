**Abstract:**
In extreme value theory, the extremal variogram is a summary of the tail dependence of a random vector. It is a central ingredient for learning extremal tree structures ([arXiv:2012.06179](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06179)) and has close connections to the estimation of Hüsler-Reiss models and extremal graphical models ([arXiv:1812.01734](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01734)). This note presents concentration results for the empirical version of the extremal variogram under general domain of attraction conditions. The results play a role in extending the findings in [arXiv:2012.06179](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06179) to increasing dimensions. The note is also the first building block for penalized estimation of sparse Hüsler-Reiss graphical models.
